## Overview

This project implements a heart-rate and SpO2 monitor using an ESP32 and a MAX30102 sensor.
Data is transmitted over I2C at 100kHz and visualised through desktop aplication on server


## Goals

Current goals
>Finish implementing I2C and Flash it on ESP32 to see if it works

>Implement to transfer data by bluetooth or wifi to my server

>Learn Machine Learning and Implement it

>Use the new data to put on pc
